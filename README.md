# Usefull-functions
some great functions I created, that I use a lot in my codes
Here is a non-exhaustive list of these, with their use : 
 * HoldOn(t0,dt)  it waits dt seconds from the t0 to the function. It's like time.sleep() but it counts from the initialization t0 = time.time(), so the time when the code runs is counted in the wait time.
 * getbitcoin()  is just an easy function I addapted to output the value of the bitcoin in an integer
